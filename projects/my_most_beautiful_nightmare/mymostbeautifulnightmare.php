    <h4>My most beautiful nightmare is a digital project that invites you to rediscover that dream that until today you simply can't forget.<br/><br/>

Trough this piece of digital poetry, I want to sensibilise people about the beauty in their deepest nightmare. They are not an escape, they are the communication between our conscious and unconscious. Dreams are an amazing language to learn that sadly doesn’t exist on duolingo. With the help of a psychoanalyst I put names and meanings on my most relevant dreams and linked them to my awaken situation.</h4>

      <p>My most beautiful nightmare is a website displaying 5 different artworks. Each of those illustrated frames brings the user in a different world with text, sounds illstrations and animations.<br/>
      This Idea has been developed and powered by my own skills from the illustrations to the developement. I let you discover all the details from the parallax to the font animations.</p>
