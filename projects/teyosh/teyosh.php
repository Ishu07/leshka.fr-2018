  <h4>
    TeYosh is a duo of Serbian Digital-Artists.<br/><br/>

    <h4>
    I had the honor to meet theses crazy fellas, help them in their beggining in the artist's world and direct them in the creation of their website. I have been working very closely with them to be sure it would reflect the personality of the creative duo.
