      Loop is an app and a service helping you to regulate your energy consumption.<br/><br/>

      The tone of voice using trough the App turns around a score. A score that the user tries to raise like in a game.<br/>
      The logo has been built trough 3 axis, the same axis we use to build the score. Like this the logo is generative and personalised.

      The coulours are based on a gradient depending of the score on a scale. If everything is good, the main colour becomes a calm blue. But if the user is spending a lot of energy, the colour change for something very vibrant. We created a grammar that in a glance we can guess what is positive for us using less energy and giving us more points.

      The Loop app connects to a home energy monitor installed in your home’s electrical and gas panel.<br/><br/>
      The Loop monitor analyzes changes in current and voltage one million times per second, giving you insights into your power consumption with unprecedented accuracy. It connects to home's Wi-Fi network and then reports real-time and historical energy use to the Mobile app, so we can monitor the efficiency of home activity from anywhere.<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <p class="lil-right">
      The App allows the user to track and manage their energy consumption. The algorithms connects to all the eligible tarrifs, allows you to accurately preview your pottential consumption and makes it the easiest way to switch your energy provider.
