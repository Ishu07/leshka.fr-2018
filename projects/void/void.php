    <h4>All art is created from nothing into something.<br/>
      Our immaginations piece together concepts which we then transform and manipulate mass to fill space.
We use the V o ID to house these pices, and we see the emptiness that surrounds them as potential for new ideas.</h4>

      <p>The concept behind VOID is all about space, how we transform it and what we can create out of it using either digital or physical technology. It’s our latest attempt at exploring how digital art can be perceived and interacted with on the internet.

From the start of this project we decided to make this a desktop experience. We felt that mobile and tablet devices didn’t have the performance capability that would allow us to provide the same experience on all platforms.<br/>
We didn’t want to feel restricted by browser or platform limitations.<br/>
The website was built using WebGL and Web audio technologies which allowed us to create high fidelity visuals and audio. This was achieved by using popular libraries like; threejs, howlerjs, GSAP and Coffee Collider.</p>

      <p>Any great journey begins with a start, middle and an end. We set out the user journey of the experience like that of a digital book.
<br/>
“ We aimed to represent VoID as a digital Book ”
<br/>
A BOOK for the story telling, the absence of interface and the way of spending user’s time on the website. The experience is gradual, aiming to drive the user to explore each artwork as if they were a chapter of a story.
DIGITAL for the flexibility, the ephemerality of the project and the technologies.

As a user, you start with a prologue introducing the concept and visual tone. Then you dive into each artwork leading to the next one.</p>
